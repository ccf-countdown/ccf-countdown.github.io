## CCF Countdown

Countdown timers to keep track of deadlines of conferences recommended by [China Computer Federation (CCF)](https://www.ccf.org.cn/xspj/gyml/).

## Adding/updating a conference

To keep things minimal, I'm only looking to list CCF conferences. Feel free to maintain a separate fork if you don't see your sub-field or conference of interest listed.

To add or update information:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline
- Send a pull request
